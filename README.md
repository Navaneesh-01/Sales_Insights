# Sales_Insights

This project analyzes a sales dataset containing 115,000 row values.

The data was initially imported into a MySQL database, where preliminary analysis was performed using SQL queries. 

The data was then extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) into Power BI.

Power Query was used for data cleaning and shaping, followed by data modeling to establish relationships between tables. 

DAX functions were implemented to create calculated columns and measures for in-depth analysis. 

The results were visualized in Power BI, and the accuracy of the visualizations was validated by cross-referencing the findings with the original data in MySQL through targeted queries, ensuring data integrity throughout the process.
